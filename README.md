# Homework 4

This quiz was created for Homework 4 challenge on web APIs. its is designed to test knowlage while keeping score and running a timer. all code is my own but I did recieve tons of help from youtube channels "Programming with Mosh" and "the coding Train" as well as "w3schools.com". frankly, with out thier help this assigmnet would have been impossible

 before each commit by code was VERY messy, in order to stay sane I also used an online JavaScript Beautifier to stay organised. I am not sure if that is allowed. if it isn't please let me know in the comments and I will not use it again in future assignments.

 lastly, While I think this assigment has been compleated within paramanters of the expectations i must stress that the difficulty is such that it was shocking. almost every part of this code has been directly writen while looking at the in class examples. everytime I did anything I had to check to see if it was correct by looking through the class notes. its hard to explain but its is as if I am trying to learn english and I can't remeber the meaning of half the letters. I am concerned about my future in this course.
